The Flight Booking Price Prediction project focuses on analyzing flight booking data to uncover valuable insights and predict flight ticket prices using advanced machine learning algorithms. This involves a thorough study of the dataset, applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and machine learning techniques to derive meaning
Key Features:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Imported and cleaned a dataset with approximately 300,000 records and 11 attributes related to flight bookings.
Handled missing values and performed data preprocessing to ensure data quality.
Data Visualization:

Visualized relationships between features, such as price variation across airlines, the impact of days left until departure on ticket prices, and price range based on class (Economy, Business).
Utilized count plots and correlation graphs to extract valuable insights.
Feature Engineering:

Applied One Hot Encoding for categorical features to convert them into numerical values suitable for machine learning models.
Conducted feature selection using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and correlation analysis to minimize multicollinearity.
Machine Learning Models:

Implemented and compared regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Achieved significant error reduction with Random Forest Regressor, demonstrating an RMSE of 2824 and a MAPE of 7.3%.
Technologies Used:

Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Project Highlights:

Conducted extensive data visualization to derive actionable insights.
Engaged in comprehensive feature engineering and selection to enhance model accuracy.
Successfully applied and compared various machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for flight price prediction.
Achieved high accuracy in price prediction, providing valuable insights for passengers to make informed booking decisions.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices with high accuracy. The insights obtained from the analysis offer substantial value to passengers, enabling them to make better-informed decisions when booking flights.
